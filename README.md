I am a [researcher at the University of Oslo](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=BtsIku0AAAAJ&hl=en), specializing in artificial intelligence applications for mental health, particularly, adolescent suicide attempts and violent extremism. My focus is on developing machine learning algorithms tailored to predict rare outcomes, i.e., modeling outcomes under _[severe class imbalance](https://journalofbigdata.springeropen.com/articles/10.1186/s40537-019-0274-4)_. My research extends to enhancing machine learning transparency, particularly in conceptualizing and stabilizing feature importance. Additionally, I am also interested in advancing statistical methods in missing data imputation and to this end, I have developed a machine learning imputation algorithm for single and multiple imputation that outperforms common statistical procedures. 

I use GitHub mostly for software development in __R__, __Stata__, and __Python__. Below is a list of _free_ software I've developed. Almost all of my Python packages are developedd for the industry and thus are not publically available. Feel free to contact me for feedback or ideas regarding my algorithms and packages. For updates on my software, follow me on Twitter: [@haghish](https://twitter.com/Haghish).

R packages
================================================================================

I have written multiple R packages for artificial intelligence as well as general statistical use. My recent software particularly focuse on machine learning, for example, missing data imputation with machine learning, developing automated stacked ensemble machine learning models for classification under severe class imbalance, toolkits for comparing different properties of machine learning models, as well as innovative procedures for assessing model transparency and classification fairness.
